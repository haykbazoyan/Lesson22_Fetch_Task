## Task about Fetch:

In index.html; main.js and style.css I resolve first task about dogs:
* Create page which contains a select with options of the following dog breeds...

To get an image I use API endpoints described https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/breed

In searchBook.html; searchScript.js and searchStyle.css I resolve second task, about book:
* Create a page to search books. For search API use this endpoint: http://openlibrary.org/search.json.
